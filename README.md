The intention for this repo is to be a collection point for *things that matter*.  It's my [commonplace book](https://ryanholiday.net/how-and-why-to-keep-a-commonplace-book/). I like to think each markdown file is a virtual 4x6 index card and filed away in a general category. üìù

Why use markdown files instead of a system like Evernote or Bear?  Because I'm a perfectionist, and if I don't have technical constraints, I grow my "productivity systems" out of nerd-like curiosity to the point where they become frankensystems and are no longer bearable to use.
